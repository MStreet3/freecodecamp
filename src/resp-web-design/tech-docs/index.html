                <p>Linked lists were developed in 1955â€“1956 by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND
                    Corporation as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language. IPL was used by
                    the authors to develop several early artificial intelligence programs, including the Logic Theory
                    Machine, the General Problem Solver, and a computer chess program. Reports on their work appeared in
                    IRE Transactions on Information Theory in 1956, and several conference proceedings from 1957 to
                    1959, including Proceedings of the Western Joint Computer Conference in 1957 and 1958, and
                    Information Processing (Proceedings of the first UNESCO International Conference on Information
                    Processing) in 1959. The now-classic diagram consisting of blocks representing list nodes with
                    arrows pointing to successive list nodes appears in "Programming the Logic Theory Machine" by Newell
                    and Shaw in Proc. WJCC, February 1957. Newell and Simon were recognized with the ACM Turing Award in
                    1975 for having "made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human
                    cognition, and list processing". The problem of machine translation for natural language processing
                    led Victor Yngve at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to use linked lists as data
                    structures in his COMIT programming language for computer research in the field of linguistics. A
                    report on this language entitled "A programming language for mechanical translation" appeared in
                    Mechanical Translation in 1958.[citation needed]</p>

                <p>
                    LISP, standing for list processor, was created by John McCarthy in 1958 while he was at MIT and in
                    1960 he published its design in a paper in the Communications of the ACM, entitled "Recursive
                    Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I". One of LISP's major
                    data structures is the linked list.

                </p>
                <p>
                    By the early 1960s, the utility of both linked lists and languages which use these structures as
                    their primary data representation was well established. Bert Green of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory
                    published a review article entitled "Computer languages for symbol manipulation" in IRE Transactions
                    on Human Factors in Electronics in March 1961 which summarized the advantages of the linked list
                    approach. A later review article, "A Comparison of list-processing computer languages" by Bobrow and
                    Raphael, appeared in Communications of the ACM in April 1964.

                <p>Several operating systems developed by Technical Systems Consultants (originally of West Lafayette
                    Indiana, and later of Chapel Hill, North Carolina) used singly linked lists as file structures. A
                    directory entry pointed to the first sector of a file, and succeeding portions of the file were
                    located by traversing pointers. Systems using this technique included Flex (for the Motorola 6800
                    CPU), mini-Flex (same CPU), and Flex9 (for the Motorola 6809 CPU). A variant developed by TSC for
                    and marketed by Smoke Signal Broadcasting in California, used doubly linked lists in the same
                    manner.</p>

                <p>The TSS/360 operating system, developed by IBM for the System 360/370 machines, used a double linked
                    list for their file system catalog. The directory structure was similar to Unix, where a directory
                    could contain files and other directories and extend to any depth. </p>

                <p>Each record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'.</p>

                <p>The field of each node that contains the address of the next node is usually called the 'next link'
                    or 'next pointer'. The remaining fields are known as the 'data', 'information', 'value', 'cargo', or
                    'payload' fields.</p>

                <p>The 'head' of a list is its first node. The 'tail' of a list may refer either to the rest of the list
                    after the head, or to the last node in the list. In Lisp and some derived languages, the next node
                    may be called the 'cdr' (pronounced could-er) of the list, while the payload of the head node may be
                    called the 'car'. </p>
                <h3>Singly Linked Lists</h3>

                    <code>
                            node addNode(node head, int value) {
                                node temp, p; // declare two nodes temp and p
                                temp = createNode(); // assume createNode creates a new node with data = 0 and next pointing to NULL.
                                temp->data = value; // add element's value to data part of node
                                if(head == NULL) {
                                    head = temp;     // when linked list is empty
                                }

                                    while(p->next != NULL) {
                                        p = p->next; // traverse the list until p is the last node.The last node always points to NULL.
                                    }
                                    p->next = temp; // Point the previous last node to the new node created.
                                }
                                return head;

                </pre>
                <h3>Doubly Linked Lists</h3>
                <p>In a 'doubly linked list', each node contains, besides the next-node link, a second link field
                    pointing to the 'previous' node in the sequence. The two links may be called 'forward('s') and
                    'backwards', or 'next' and 'prev'('previous'). </p>

                <p>A technique known as XOR-linking allows a doubly linked list to be implemented using a single link
                    field in each node. However, this technique requires the ability to do bit operations on addresses,
                    and therefore may not be available in some high-level languages.</p>

                <p>Many modern operating systems use doubly linked lists to maintain references to active processes,
                    threads, and other dynamic objects.[2] A common strategy for rootkits to evade detection is to
                    unlink themselves from these lists.[3] </p>
